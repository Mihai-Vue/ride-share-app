            <p>
                Lyft is a platform that connects drivers with individuals and
                organizations that need rides.
            </p>
            <p>In addition to helping passengers get from A to B, in select markets
                drivers may also opt in to deliver essential items — such as groceries,
                medical supplies, and home necessities — to people who need them.
            </p>
            <p>
                We know this is a challenging time, and as the COVID-19 crisis continues
                the well-being of Lyft drivers is our priority. <a href={url}>Visit our site</a> to learn
                what steps we’re taking to support drivers, and how we’re finding new opportunities for
                them to earn while helping their communities.
